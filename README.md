# rackstack

![display](media/renders/rackDisplayRounded.png)

### A modular 3d-printable mini rack system
- ***Mount Anything:*** Perfect for organizing SBCs, mini PCs, small switches, power hubs, etc.
- ***Fully customizable:*** Fully written in OpenSCAD. Everything, from the dimensions of the rack, to the roundness of the corners, can be modified with a simple code change.
- ***Printable from home:*** Designed to be printed with conventional FDM printers. Requires minimal supports when printing, and final assembly needs only a few easy-to-source parts. 
- ***No cage nuts:*** Sliding hex nut design for the front rails allows one to easily mount items, without dealing with cage nuts.
- ***Stackable:*** Individual racks can be easily stacked and fastened together. Mix and match different color and design combinations!

## Assembly

Pre-generated STLs for roughly 200mm^3 (mini), 180mm^3 (micro), and 100mm^3 (nano) rack frames can be found in the [stl](stl) dir.
These STLs are generated from the files in [rack/print](rack/print) - further information about printing these parts 
(supports, orientation) can be found in these files.

### Assembly Instructions
Please see [the assembly guide](./assembly-guide).

### BOM - Required Tools:
- 3d FDM Printer - build size requirements depend on configured rack profile
- M3 Allen Key (for constructing the rack)
- M4 Allen Key (for mounting rack-mount items)

### BOM - Single Rack:

### Printing - Single Rack:
| Part                                                 | Quantity |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| [Left Y-Bar](./rack/print/yBarLeft_P.scad)           | 2        |
| [Right Y-Bar](./rack/print/yBarRight_P.scad)         | 2        |
| [X-Bar](./rack/print/xBar_P.scad)                    | 4        |
| [Main Rail](./rack/print/mainRail_P.scad)            | 4        |
| [Left Side Wall](./rack/print/sideWallLeft_P.scad)   | 1        |
| [Right Side Wall](./rack/print/sideWallRight_P.scad) | 1        |
| [XY-Plate](./rack/print/xyPlate_P.scad)              | 2        |
| [Feet](./rack/print/rackFeet_P.scad) (optional)      | 2        |


#### Notes: 
- ⚠️ Before printing the actual parts. It's recommended to print this evaluation part: [eval_P.scad](./rack/print/eval_P.scad) to test tolerances. 
  If you find the fits too tight/loose, you can adjust them [here](./config/print.scad). Please make sure also adjust the layer height in that file, too.
- Omitted actual plastic for printing. Any conventional 3d printing plastic should do (PLA, PETG, ABS),
but beware of PLA's thermal limits. Higher infill is recommended for all parts.
- For joining two racks, you will need to print 4 [rackJoiners](./rack/print/rackJoiner_P.scad), as well as 8 M3 hex nuts, and 8 M3x12 FHCS.
- Main front rails use M4 hex nuts and screws.
- Side rails are mounted using M3 hex nuts and screws.


## Configuring + Generating STLs
A python script:  [rbuild.py](./rbuild.py) is provided to generate different project stls. **Before running the script**, please 
configure the path to the OpenSCAD binary in [rbuild.py](./rbuild.py).

Requirements:
  - `openscad` CLI binary
  - `python3`

### Examples:
Generate all project files for the `micro` profile:

`python3 rbuild.py -b all -c micro`

This will build all the parts defined in [rack/print](./rack/print), and put the STLs in [stl/micro](./stl/micro). 
You can also provide a `-dz {n}` parameter to adjust the height of the generated rack. Configuring other rack
variables can be done in [config/rackframe.scad](./config/rackFrame.scad).

For generating a specific part, and putting it into a new `stl/custom` target directory: 

`python3 rbuild.py -b yBar -c micro -t custom`

`rbuild.py` also support an optional `--nightly` flag, which will run a nightly build of OpenSCAD. Please make sure the
path to the nightly build is also configured in [rbuild.py](./rbuild.py).


### ⚠️ Important:
Before committing to a full print, please try printing an evaluation print: [eval_P.scad](./rack/print/eval_P.scad) to test tolerances.
It is very likely you will need to edit the default tolerances in [print.scad](./config/print.scad) for a nice fit.


## Trays, Boxes, etc

Some parametric rack mount systems can be found in [rack-mount](./rack-mount). The following rack-mount systems 
are currently supported:
- [Enclosed Box](./rack-mount/enclosed-box): For mounting box-shaped objects, without the need for any mounting holes on the box.
- [Tray](./rack-mount/tray): Simple tray mounted using only the front rails. Can be configured to have screw mounts at the bottom of the tray.
- [Patch Panel](./rack-mount/patch-panel): Linear patch panel array. Number of keystone slots can be configured.
- [Angle Brackets](./rack-mount/angle-bracket): Simple Angle Bracket mounting system. Derived from the Enclosed Box system.

## Rack Mount Catalog

There is a small catalog of various pre-configured rack-mountable parts in the [catalog](./rack-mount/catalog) directory. Please feel free to add anything even remotely
useful!

## Designing rack-mount items

Some useful variables for designing your own rack-mount items can be found in [rack-mount/dimensionHelper.scad](./rack-mount/dimensionHelper.scad).

## plan your rack mount

A skeleton is pre assamble here for the micro rack if you whant to plan your rack mounts. You can use ad CAD tool to add and place you generated stl files and preview cables and congestion of your stuff.
